# Project Movies
Create a movie multi-page React application using themoviedb.org API. 

## The problem
Technologies used: React, React Router, API, Dev tools, VS Code
I did prepare for adding a "page not found", if I had more time I would also add a loading message, a dropdown and more pages. I would also make it responsive and accessible.
