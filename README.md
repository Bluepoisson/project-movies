# Project Movies
Create a movie multi-page React application using themoviedb.org API. 

## The problem
Technologies used: React, React Router, API, Dev tools 
I did prepare for adding a "page not found", if I had more time I would also add a loading message, a dropdown and more pages. I would also make it responsive and accessible.
Would like to know if there's an easy way to add url component, in order to keep code tighter.
